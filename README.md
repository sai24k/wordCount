Step 1: Check If Hadoop Is Installed
Open the Terminal in Cloudera and run:

sh
Copy
Edit
hadoop version
If Hadoop is installed correctly, you will see its version. If not, let me know so I can guide you on installing it.

Step 2: Set Hadoop Classpath
If Hadoop is installed but still shows the error, try setting the classpath manually:

sh
Copy
Edit
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$(hadoop classpath)
To make this setting permanent, add it to your .bashrc file:

sh
Copy
Edit
echo 'export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=$(hadoop classpath)' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
Now, try running:

sh
Copy
Edit
hadoop classpath
Step 3: Verify Apache Commons Logging Library
Run this command to check if the required JAR files exist:

sh
Copy
Edit
find /usr/lib/hadoop -name "commons-logging-*.jar"
If you find the JAR file, add it to your Hadoop job manually when running:

sh
Copy
Edit
hadoop jar wc1.jar wc1 -libjars /usr/lib/hadoop/lib/commons-logging-1.1.3.jar /path/to/input /path/to/output
Step 4: Run Your Hadoop Job in Eclipse
Open Eclipse in Cloudera.

Right-click your wc1 project > Properties > Java Build Path.

Under Libraries, click Add External JARs.

Add the following JAR files from Hadoopâ€™s lib directory:

commons-logging-*.jar
hadoop-common-*.jar
hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-*.jar
Any missing dependencies
Click Apply and Close.

Run your Hadoop program inside Eclipse.

Step 5: Run the Hadoop Job Manually
If you still get an error in Eclipse, try running it manually from the terminal:

sh
Copy
Edit
hadoop jar wc1.jar wc1 /user/cloudera/input /user/cloudera/output
Then, check the output:

sh
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /user/cloudera/output/part-r-00000

âœ… Step 1: Check If the JAR File Exists
Run this command:

sh
Copy
Edit
ls -lh /home/cloudera/wc1.jar
If the file does not exist, you need to recompile and package your JAR (see Step 2).
If the file exists but is corrupt, recreate it.
âœ… Step 2: Recompile and Create the JAR File
Navigate to the directory where your wc1.java file is located:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd /home/cloudera
Then, recompile it with Hadoop dependencies:

sh
Copy
Edit
javac -classpath $(hadoop classpath) -d . wc1.java
Now, package it into a JAR:

sh
Copy
Edit
jar cf wc1.jar wc1/*.class
Check if the JAR was created:

sh
Copy
Edit
ls -lh wc1.jar
âœ… Step 3: Run the Hadoop Job
Now try running your job again:

sh
Copy
Edit
hadoop jar wc1.jar wc1 /user/cloudera/input /user/cloudera/output
If you get a missing dependency error (like commons-logging), try adding:

sh
Copy
Edit
hadoop jar wc1.jar wc1 -libjars /usr/lib/hadoop/lib/commons-logging-1.1.3.jar /user/cloudera/input /user/cloudera/output
âœ… Step 4: Verify the Output
If the job runs successfully, check the results:

sh
Copy
Edit
hdfs dfs -cat /user/cloudera/output/part-r-00000
Let me know if you still face issues! ðŸš€


It seems that the start-dfs.sh script is not available in your current environment. This could be because your Cloudera setup might have a different method to start Hadoop services.

Try these steps instead:

âœ… Step 1: Start Hadoop Services Using Cloudera Manager
If you're using Cloudera's distribution, you can use the Cloudera Manager to manage your Hadoop services. Follow these steps:

Open your web browser and navigate to the Cloudera Manager UI (typically, it's http://<cloudera-manager-host>:7180).
Log in with your username and password (default is admin/admin).
In the Cloudera Manager UI, go to the Hadoop services section.
Ensure that HDFS and YARN services are running. You can start them from here if they are stopped.
âœ… Step 2: Starting Hadoop Services via Command Line
If you're not using Cloudera Manager, you might need to start the services manually using the hadoop commands.

You can try the following commands to start the services:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo service hadoop-hdfs-namenode start
sudo service hadoop-hdfs-datanode start
sudo service hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager start
sudo service hadoop-yarn-nodemanager start
These commands may vary depending on your Cloudera setup. You might need sudo or root privileges to execute these commands.

âœ… Step 3: Verify Hadoop Daemons
After starting the services, check if the Hadoop daemons (such as NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, and NodeManager) are running by executing:

sh
Copy
Edit
jps
You should see processes like NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, NodeManager, etc.

After these steps, try running your job again:

sh
Copy
Edit
hadoop jar /home/cloudera/wc1.jar wc1.wc1 /user/cloudera/input /user/cloudera/output
